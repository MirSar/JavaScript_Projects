#JavaScript Projects
------------------------------------------------------
This is part of my course work for The Tech Academy's Software Developer
program.
For this course we created a display of sample websites, using HTML, CSS 
and JavaScript.

##PROJECTS
------------------------------------------------------
* Pizza Menu for a virtual pizzaria
* Online Tic-Tac-Toe Game
* Online functioning basic Calculator with a personality

###Pizza Menu project

This project is an online menu used to order pizza with a selection of various
toppings to choose from. The user input information is taken and a price for the
order is generated and displayed on the page.

###Online Tic-Tac-Toe game

The is an online version of the classical Tic-Tac-Toe game.  The user plays
against the computer (very basic AI is used here :)). The program uses
Javascript to calculate which squares are in play and which ones can be selected,
it plays audio and animates the winning row.
Future improvements will include option to play against a player or computer,
a selection of pics to represent X's and O's, improved AI, and score keeping system.
All of which can be easily accomplished with the use of JavaScript.

###Basic Calculator project

A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide any
two numbers. JavaScript gives this simple calculator a fun personality.
Future imporvements: additional functions and flashier effects :)
